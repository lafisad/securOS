# SecurOS *ver Beta*

## Repository structure
- `src`: Contains the source code for the SecurOS kernel.
- `docs`: Contains documentation for the SecurOS kernel.


## Wanna contribute?
... dont. Please. I mean you can _obviously_ fork the repo, but I will probably not accept any pull requests.

The thing is that this entire project is a joke. I'll probably finish everything **up to** having a working kernel that is extremely hardened, secure, and efficient. But nothing more. lol
